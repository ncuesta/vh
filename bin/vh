You seem to have missed some arguments.
Here is a simple usage section for you to enjoy:

    #{$0} PATH HOSTNAME

Where:
    - PATH:     Is a filesystem path (relative or absolute) to the web root.
    - HOSTNAME: Is the hostname that you'll use to access the web.

For instance, executing:

    #{$0} ./web my.nifty.server

Will create a new web root at ./web that will be accessed
via http://my.nifty.server/
