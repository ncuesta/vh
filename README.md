# vh

Virtual Hosts manager for the CLI -- a dead simple script to add new virtual hosts
that will ease the local development of web apps with Apache.

**This is currently a WIP so things will not likely work** :)

## Prerequisites

Add this line to your `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf`:

    Include /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'vh'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vh

## Usage

Running `vh` is pretty straight-forward:

    vh path hostname

Where:

   * `path` is the path to the `DocumentRoot` of the Virtual Host, and
   * `hostname` is the hostname that will be used locally for the VH.
